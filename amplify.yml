# This YAML file defines configuration settings for an application or service.
# It typically includes parameters such as environment variables, service endpoints,
# authentication credentials, and other customizable options required for deployment
# or runtime behavior. Each key-value pair represents a specific configuration item,
# and nested structures may be used to organize related settings. Ensure sensitive
# information is handled securely and not exposed in version control.
